we each haver every reason to want

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm tired of killing his slaves for him

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm not a slave. I am, that's why I killed Cato

13
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and he killed Thresh, and Thresh

14
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
killed Clove

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it just goes around and around anyways

16
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Always Snow. I am done being at piece in

17
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
his game. District 12, district 2,

18
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
we have no fight except the one the

19
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Capitol gave us. Why are you fighting the

20
00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:09.000
rebels? your neighbors? your family?

21
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
these people are not your enemy we all

22
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
have one enemy and that's Snow

23
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He corrupts everyone and everything

24
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He turns the best of us against each other

25
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
stop killing for him, tonight turn your

26
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
weapons to the Capitol, turn your weapons

27
00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to Snow.
